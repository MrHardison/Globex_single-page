      <p class="text text_mb42">
        There are several ways to manage cookies. Any settings you apply may change your Internet browsing and your conditions of access to certain services that require the use of cookies.</p>
      <p class="text text_mb42">
        You can make the choice at any time to express and modify your wishes with regard to cookies,w by the means described belo.
      </p>
      <h3 class="h3">The choices offered by your navigation software</h3>
      <p class="text text_mb42">
        You can configure your navigation software so that cookies are recorded on your device or rejected, either systematically, or depending on their issuer. You can also set up your browser software so that acceptance or rejection of cookies is proposed to you, before a cookie is likely to be recorded in your terminal.
      </p>
      <h3 class="h3">Cookies agreement</h3>
      <p class="text text_mb42">
        The recording of a cookie in a terminal is essentially subordinated to the will of the user of the terminal, which the user can express and modify at any time and without paying for it, through the choices offered to him by his navigation software.
      </p>
      <p class="text text_mb42">
        If you have accepted in your browser the recording of cookies in your terminal, the cookies embedded in the pages and contents that you have consulted can be stored temporarily in a dedicated space of your terminal. They will be readable only by their issuer.
      </p>
      <h3 class="h3">Cookies refusal</h3>
      <p class="text text_mb42">
        If you refuse to record cookies on your device, or delete those which are recorded, you will no longer benefit from a certain number of features that are necessary to navigate to certain spaces of our platform. This would be the case if you tried to access our content or services that require you to be identified. This would also be the case if we - or our service providers - could not recognize, for technical compatibility purposes, the type of browser used by your device, its language and display settings or the country from which your device seems to be connected to the Internet.
      </p>
      <p class="text text_mb42">
        In that case, we accept no responsibility for any consequences arising from the degraded functioning of our services resulting from the fact that we cannot record or consult the cookies necessary for their operation and which you have refused or deleted.

      <h3 class="h3">How to exercise your choices, depending on the browser you are using?</h3>
      <p class="text text_mb22">
        For the management of cookies and your choices, the configuration of each browser is different. It is described in the help menu of your browser, which will allow you to know how to change your settings for cookies:
